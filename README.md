# Modelling With Graphs Coursework 2020
(2020) Modelling with Graphs submodule coursework submission for the Computational Thinking module at Durham University

## Description
This coursework is divided into two parts, graph colouring and graph traversing

## Questions
### Graph Colouring
  1. A file called `greedy_col.py.py` that visits the vertices of an input graph sequentially, irregardless of adjacency, and greedily assigns the smallest possible colour to each vertex it visists such that no adjacent vertices have the same colour.
  2. A file called `greedy_col_variation.py` that visits the vertices of an input graph, in a way that next vertex is always adjacent to a previously visited vertex. Again colours are greedily assigned to each vertex visited such that no adjacent vertices have the same colour.
  3. *This question is not included in this repository.*
### Graph Traversal
  1. A file called `breadth_first.py` which performs a [Breadth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) starting from a given vertex *a* and ends once it reaches another given vertex *b*. This then outputs the length of the shortest path between the two given vertices.
